Linear Regression Example Application Readme
Last revised 15th April 2007


1. Application Overview
-----------------------

The linear regression application generates the summary statistics of points to 
give the linear approximation of all of the points. It reads the x-y coordinates
sequentially from the specified file.


2. Provided Files
-----------------

linear_regression.c: The version of the file that uses the MapReduce engine
linear_regression_serial.c: The sequential version of the application
linear_regression_pthread.c: The pthread version of the application
stddefines.h: Contains declarations of commonly used functions and constants
MapReduceScheduler.c/h: The MapReduce engine used by the application
Makefile: Compiles all 3 versions of the application
datafiles/key_file*.txt: Files of various sizes that contain input coordinates
README: This file


3. Running the Application
--------------------------

run 'make' to compile all 3 versions of the application. 

./lreg <file-name>
./lreg-pthread <file-name>
./lreg-seq <file-name>

runs the MapReduce, Pthreads and sequential version of the application
respectively
