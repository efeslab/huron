TMI provides false-sharing detection and protection capabilities for native 
applications (C,C++,Assembly).

For detection only, TMI adds an additional thread and an additional perf object
per thread that tracks the HITM events produced by each thread.

Build Parameters
----------

TMI_USING_MKSTEMP: Use the mkstemp function to create a shared file instead of
using shm_open.  This was found to be necessary for some applications such as
parsec.facesim.

TMI_PROTECT: Enables the TMI protection mechanisms

Environment Parameters
----------

TMI_SAMPLE_PERIOD: How frequently events are reported from the Intel
hardware counters back to the TMI false-sharing detector (e.g. 
TMI_SAMPLE_PERIOD=1000 means that every 1000th HITM event will be
sent to the detector)

TMI_WINDOW_SIZE: How frequently the detector state is cleared
(e.g. TMI_WINDOW_SIZE=100 means that every 100th HITM event will
cause the detector's state to be cleared)

TMI_EXE_NAME: Name of the executable being run (only necessary when 
running as an LD_PRELOAD library, otherwise will be detected from 
command-line options) (only for detector output purposes)

TMI_OUTPUT_PATH: Path to output detector results to (defaults to 
/scratch/results)
